## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is a monorepo with two main folders:

* `frontend/`: Contains the React client application.
    * `src/pages/`: Main page components (e.g., `DashboardPage.js`, `LoginPage.js`).
    * `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `Header.js`, `SkeletonCard.js`).
    * `src/App.js`: Main application component with routing.
    * `src/index.js`: Entry point of the React application.
* `backend/`: Contains the Node.js Express API.
    * `config/`: Database connection, etc.
    * `controllers/`: Logic for handling requests.
    * `middleware/`: Custom middleware (auth, error handling).
    * `models/`: Mongoose schemas.
    * `routes/`: API route definitions.
    * `server.js`: Main server entry point.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version, e.g., v18.x or v20.x)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
* MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
* Git

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd smart-learning-recommender
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Create a `.env` file in `backend/` (see "Environment Variables" section).
    * Start the server: `npm start` (or `npm run dev` if you have a nodemon script).
    * The backend typically runs on `http://localhost:5001`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd ../frontend`
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Create a `.env` file in `frontend/` (see "Environment Variables" section).
